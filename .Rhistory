Wage = Wage
##I am predicting Wage with:
### smoothing spline of age with 4 dF (s() is the smoothing spline function)
### Smoothing spline of year with 4 dF
### Education is factor variable but we want to add it, no need to smooth. Step Function is applied.
levels(Wage$education)
gam1=gam(wage~s(age,df=6)+s(year,df=6)+education,data=Wage)
## Remember, GAM is taking only these 3 variables into account because we added those.
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(gam1,se=T)
#Salaries increase with age then decrease
#there seemed to be an general increase for year collected, except around 2007 (recession)
#Advanced Degrees are significant in increasing wage
