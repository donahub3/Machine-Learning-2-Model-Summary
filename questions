1. How do you determine the best model when doing polynomial logistic regression? Is it anova, cross-validation, or something else? 
  A: To figure out the degree of the polynomial, run anova. To determine accuracy rate, convert the output probabilities to factors and make a confusion matrix. 
  
2. How does anova work? 
  A: anova only works when the models are nested (each subsequent model contains the previous one). For example, a polynomial with degree 4 will include the 3rd degree model. 
    The resid. column shows the residual of the model. If anova shows a significant difference between models, choose the model with the lowest residual score. 
  
3. For boosting, what is the difference between distribution='bernoulli' and distribution='gaussian'?
  A: Bernoulli is used for classification trees, Gaussian is for regression
  
4. The gbm() function (for boosting) requires that you convert the Y variable to numeric. The people who write R libraries do not care about consistency. 
  In R, this looks like: 
  
  #First we need to create a numeric version of the attrition variable 
  #as.numeric(attrition.train$attrition) produces 1 for No and 2 for Yes
  #so we need to shift the distribution by -1
  
  attritionDF$numAttrition <- as.numeric(attritionDF$attrition)-1
  attrition.train <- attritionDF[train.indices.attrition, ]
  attrition.test <- attritionDF[-train.indices.attrition, ]

5. How do you calculate degrees of freedom for natural splines? 
  A: Total DF includes an extra degree of freedom that R does not. She'll try to be clear about it. But maybe not
